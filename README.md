# edu-trail
This project is the set of solutions to my educational trail exercises

1. Risk Assessment & Mitigation BPMNs are the models for ex1, to cover the various BPMN constructs.
2. This project also has an implementation of custom tasklist, as simple HTML pages,implemented with jQuery & bootstrap. This POC is to demonstrate the ease of Tasklist API access 
3. Insights.BPMN is the model to showcase interaction with the APIs using JSON.

This project is WIP. It will be updated as I keep covering the different exercises.
